# Webmonkeys React Slides

These are the slides I used for my React talk at one of our weekly Webmonkeys meetings at UIUC (Tuesday 17 October 2017).

## Reference

These slides use the awesome "Spectacle" package made by [Ken Wheeler](https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler) at Formidable Labs.
For more about spectacle, check out [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/).

## I wanna check them out
